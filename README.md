# DAT250: Software Technology Experiment Assignment 6
## Experiment 2: Single-page applications
This is my attempt at using Angular to build an SPA to implement a Todo list, while using the Rest-API developed in experiment 4.

I have used the Angular tutorial Tour of Heroes as a starting point, and modified it to be Todo list application.
I have tried to use the Rest-API from experiment 4, but I'm not sure if I have done it correctly.
I don't know TypeScript so this has been a very hard experiment/assignment, but I have tried my best.

## How to run:
Navigate to .\dat250-experiment6\TodoApp, and run the 'ng serve' in the terminal to start the Angular application.

## Comments:
Like I mentioned before, I tried to use the Rest-API from experiment 4, but I'm not sure if I have done it correctly.
It seems it's not done correctly because f.ex. posting via Postman does not yield a new Todo in the Angular application.
